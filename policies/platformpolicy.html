              <p>Platforms are classified as "primary", "secondary", "community"
                 and "unadopted". Support for a new platform should only be
                 added if it is being adopted as a primary, secondary or
                 community platform.</a></p>
              <dl>
                <dt>Primary</dt>
                <dd>
                  <em>Definition:</em> A platform that is regularly tested
                  through project CI on a project owned and managed system
                  <br/><br/>

                  New Pull Requests (PRs) should not be merged unless the
                  primary platforms are showing as "green" in CI. If the CI
                  breaks for a branch (such as for a stable version or master)
                  then it should be fixed as a priority.<br/><br/>
                </dd>
                <dt>Secondary</dt>
                <dd>
                  <em>Definition:</em> A platform that is regularly tested
                  through project CI on a system that is not owned or managed by
                  the project. At least one project committer must have access
                  to the system and be able and willing to support it.<br/><br/>

                  New Pull Requests (PRs) should avoid introducing new breaks to
                  CI in secondary platforms where possible but may still be
                  merged where a resolution is not easily achievable without
                  access to the platform. If the CI for a branch (such as for a
                  stable version or master) on a secondary platform breaks, then
                  a resolution should be sought as soon as is practically
                  possible and before a release is made from the branch.<br/><br/>
                </dd>
                <dt>Community</dt>
                <dd>
                  <em>Definition:</em> Platforms that one or more members of the
                  OpenSSL community have volunteered to support. May or may not
                  be in project CI. Members of the community providing support
                  do not have to be committers.<br/><br/>

                  Where a community platform is in project CI then new Pull
                  Requests (PRs) should avoid introducing new breaks to CI on
                  such platforms where possible but may still be merged where a
                  resolution is not easily achievable without access to the
                  platform. If the CI for a branch (such as for a
                  stable version or master) on a community platform breaks, then
                  an attempt should be made to contact the community maintainer
                  to request a fix. In the event that a community platform is
                  broken in CI for a protacted period then it may be dropped
                  from CI.<br/>

                  If defects are raised that are specific to a community
                  platform then the community maintainer may be contacted to
                  help find a resolution. If a community maintainer is
                  unresponsive, or unable to provide fixes then the platform may
                  be moved to "unadopted".<br/><br/>

                <dd>
                  <em>Definition:</em> Platforms that no one has volunteered to
                  support.<br/><br/>
                  Support may still be provided for such platforms where
                  possible without access to the platform itself. Platform
                  specific issues may be left unresolved where it is not
                  feasible to find a suitable fix. Support for such platforms
                  may be removed entirely from the OpenSSL code base in future
                  releases.
