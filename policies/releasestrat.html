	  <p>
	    As of release 3.0.0, the OpenSSL versioning scheme is changing
	    to a more contemporary format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    With this format, API/ABI compatibility will only be guaranteed
	    for the same MAJOR version number. Previously we guaranteed
	    API/ABI compatibility across the same MAJOR.MINOR combination.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    This more closely aligns with the expectations of users who are
	    familiar with semantic versioning.  However, we have not adopted
	    semantic versioning in the strict sense of its rules, because it
	    would mean changing our current LTS policies and practices.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The current 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versioning scheme remains unchanged:

	    <blockquote><i>
	      As of release 1.0.0 the OpenSSL versioning scheme was improved
	      to better meet developers' and vendors' expectations. Letter
	      releases, such as 1.0.2a, exclusively contain bug and security
	      fixes and no new features. Minor releases that change the
	      last digit, e.g. 1.1.0 vs. 1.1.1, can and are likely to
	      contain new features, but in a way that does not break binary
	      compatibility. This means that an application compiled and
	      dynamically linked with 1.1.0 does not need to be recompiled
	      when the shared library is updated to 1.1.1. It should be
	      noted that some features are transparent to the application
	      such as the maximum negotiated TLS version and cipher suites,
	      performance improvements and so on. There is no need to
	      recompile applications to benefit from these features.
	    </i></blockquote>

	  <hr />

	  <p>With regards to current and future releases the OpenSSL
	  project has adopted the following policy:</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>Version 1.1.1 will be supported until 2023-09-11 (LTS)</li>
	    <li>Version 1.1.0 will be supported until 2019-09-11.</li>
	    <li>Version 1.0.2 will be supported until 2019-12-31 (LTS).</li>
            <li>Version 1.0.1 is no longer supported.</li>
	    <li>Version 1.0.0 is no longer supported.</li>
	    <li>Version 0.9.8 is no longer supported.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>We may designate a release as a Long Term Support (LTS)
	  release. LTS releases will be supported for at least five years
	  and we will specify one at least every four years. Non-LTS
	  releases will be supported for at least two years.</p>

	  <p>During the final year
	  of support, we do not commit to anything other than security
	  fixes. Before that, bug and security fixes will be applied
	  as appropriate.</p>

	  <hr />

	  <p>An alpha release means:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Not (necessarily) feature complete</li>
	    <li>Not necessarily all new APIs in place yet</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>A beta release means:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Feature complete/Feature freeze (but may include a non-final implementation of the TLSv1.3 specification)</li>
	    <li>Bug fixes only</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>We have defined the following release criteria for 1.1.1:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>All open github issues/PRs older than 2 weeks at the time of release
	    to be assessed for relevance to 1.1.1. Any flagged with the 1.1.1
	    milestone to be closed (see below)</li>
	    <li>Clean builds in Travis and Appveyor for two days</li>
	    <li>run-checker.sh to be showing as clean 2 days before release</li>
	    <li>No open Coverity issues (not flagged as "False Positive" or "Ignore")</li>
	    <li>TLSv1.3 RFC published (with at least one beta release after the publicaction)</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>Valid reasons for closing an issue/PR with a 1.1.1 milestone might be:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>We have just now or sometime in the past fixed the issue</li>
	    <li>Unable to reproduce (following discussion with original reporter if
	    possible)</li>
	    <li>Working as intended</li>
	    <li>Deliberate decision not to fix until a later release (this wouldn't
	    actually close the issue/PR but change the milestone instead)</li>
	    <li>Not enough information and unable to contact reporter</li>
	    <li>etc</li>
	  </ul>
