        <p>Note that this page contains historic information about our legacy
			OpenSSL FIPS Object Module (FOM) 2.0. For information about the OpenSSL
	    FOM 3.0 refer to
	    <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man7/fips_module.html">the FIPS module manual page</a>
	    </p>
	    <p>The most recent validation of a cryptographic
	    module (Module) compatible with OpenSSL 1.0.2
	    is v2.0.16, FIPS 140-2 certificate <a
	    href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/Certificate/1747">#1747</a>.
	    This Module is documented in the
	    <a href="fips/UserGuide-2.0.pdf">2.0 User Guide</a>;
	    the <a href="/source/openssl-fips-2.0.16.tar.gz">source code</a>,
	    and <a href="fips/SecurityPolicy-2.0.16.pdf">Security Policy</a>
            are also available.

            <p>
	    For various bureaucratic reasons, the same module is also
	    available as validation <a
            href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/Certificate/2398">#2398</a>
	    (revision 2.0.16).
	    </p>

            <p>
            Neither validation will work with any release other than 1.0.2.
            The OpenSSL project is no longer maintaining either the 1747
            or the 2398 module. This includes adding platforms to those
            validations.
            The OpenSSL project is no longer involved in private label
            validations nor adding platforms to the existing certificates.
            </p>

            <p>
	    Here is the complete set of files. Note that if you are interested
            in the "1747" validation, you only need the three files mentioned
            above.</p>

	    <ul>

	      <li>OpenSSL itself is not validated.  Instead a special
	      carefully defined software component called the OpenSSL FIPS
	      Object Module has been created.  This Module was designed for
	      compatibility with OpenSSL so that products using the OpenSSL
	      API can be converted to use validated cryptography with minimal
	      effort.</li>

	      <li>The OpenSSL FIPS Object Module 2.0 validation is "delivered" in
	      source code form, meaning that if you can use it exactly as is
	      and can build it (according to the very specific documented
	      instructions) for your platform, then you can use it as
	      validated cryptography on a "vendor affirmed" basis.</li>

	      <li>If even a single line of the source code or build process
              has to be changed
	      for your intended application, you cannot use the open
	      source based validated module directly.  You must obtain your
	      own validation.</li>
